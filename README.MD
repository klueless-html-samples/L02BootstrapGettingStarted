# L02 Bootstrap Getting Started

> L02 Bootstrap Getting Started in HTML

As a UX Designer, I want to use an off the shelf CSS framework, so that I can style my website components quickly

## Development

Run VSCode Live Server on index.html or open in your browser

```bash
# cd [YouCustomDevFolder]
git clone git@github.com:klueless-html-samples/L02BootstrapGettingStarted.git && cd L02BootstrapGettingStarted

# use a command to open index.html in browser.
# this is how I setup my Mac alias for chrome
# alias chrome="open -a Google\ Chrome"
chrome index.html
```
